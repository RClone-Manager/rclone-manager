### 1️⃣ Terminal Window Flash on Windows

🔗 [Track on GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/RClone-Manger/projects/6/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=110319862)  
(“Investigate workaround for terminal flash on Windows”)

On **Windows**, you may see a **brief terminal window flash** either:

- When **starting RClone Manager**, or
- When running certain Rclone operations like **mounting remotes** or **OAuth authentication**.

This is **not a bug in RClone Manager**, but a side effect of how the **official Rclone binary** is compiled:

> ⚙️ **Rclone is compiled as a console application using Go**, and on Windows, such binaries always open a terminal window when executed — even if launched from a GUI app.

#### ✅ What This Means

- This behavior is **harmless** and does **not affect** functionality.
- It is simply a side effect of **how Rclone is compiled**, not something we directly control.

#### 🔮 Future Plans & Workarounds

We are actively looking into solutions to suppress the terminal window:

- ✨ **Build a GUI version of Rclone**
  A custom Rclone binary can be compiled with Go using:
  `go build -ldflags="-H windowsgui" -o rclone.exe`
  This prevents the terminal window from opening.

- 🤝 **Contribute upstream**
  We’re considering proposing a **pull request to the Rclone project** to provide an optional “GUI mode” build target for better GUI integration.

Any approach will ensure full CLI compatibility is preserved.

### 2️⃣ Linux: Sleep Inhibition with Mounted Remotes

On some Linux systems (e.g., GNOME desktop), it has been observed that after mounting a remote, the system may be prevented from sleeping or suspending. It is unclear if this is caused by RClone Manager, the file manager, or another process.

#### 🐧 User Observations

- After mounting a remote, the system sometimes does not enter sleep mode as expected.
- Using `gdbus` to inspect session inhibitors:

  ```sh
  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.GetInhibitors
  # ([objectpath '/org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754'],)
  ```

- Attempts to query specific inhibitors;

  ```sh
  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.GetInhibitors
  # ([objectpath '/org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754'],)

  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754 \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor.GetFlags
  # (uint32 5,)

  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754 \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor.GetAppId
  # ('org.gnome.Nautilus',)

  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754 \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor.GetClientId
  # Error: GDBus.Error:org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor.NotSet: Value is not set

  gdbus call --session \
    --dest org.gnome.SessionManager \
    --object-path /org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor754 \
    --method org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor.GetReason
  # ('Copying Files',)
  ```

  In this case, the inhibitor is set by `org.gnome.Nautilus` (the GNOME Files app), with the reason "Copying Files". This suggests the file manager may be responsible for sleep inhibition when interacting with mounted remotes.

#### ❓ Status

- Currently, the app does not appear to directly inhibit sleep.
- The cause may be related to the file manager or how the remote is mounted.
- Further investigation is needed to determine if this is an upstream issue or if RClone Manager can/should handle sleep inhibition explicitly.

If you experience this issue, please provide details about your Linux distribution, desktop environment, and steps to reproduce.

> **Note:**
> It is currently unclear whether this sleep inhibition is caused by RClone Manager, the file manager, or another process involved in mounting and accessing remotes.
